Howdy, folks!

Here I am, back in this blog! Actually this is another domain, `lucas.ninja` instead of `agtlucas.com`, but it's the same blog, so, this post is for explain this changes and what will come next...

As you can see, this is a new layout, much more simpler than the old one, and faster, much faster! #perfmatters! More this later.

## Why this changes?

Good question, I don't know! Yeah, I think that this whole changes it's because I like to build and break things, and you know what, this is a good thing, break and build things is awesome, we can learn a lot.

## Why lucas.ninja and no more agtlucas.com?

I think `lucas.ninja` is way more cool. :)

## What comes next?

This year (2015) I'm working in some really awesome projects, and as I'm learning Swift, I'll try to post some stuff about this language, I can't promise that, but I'll try.

Talking about language, I intend to post more technical stuff, like JavaScript, RWD, Web Accessibility (Can I include A11Y as technical?). Also, I wanna talk about Sales and SaaS, two subjects that I've been studying these last days.

## Challenges

This is my last year in college and I hope that everything gonna end well. I still need to figure out what kind of project I'll do to my "TCC", I have some ideas but I'm not quite sure yet...

Anyway, but this is gonna be awesome, that's for sure!

## A little about this new layout

So, this blog's still powered by Jekyll, but I'm using <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/" target="_blank">CloudFlare</a> for CDN and SSL. The free tier is pretty rad!

The little bit of JavaScript and almost all stylesheet are inlined which means less requisition, more performance. Sorta.

Also, I "borrowed" the syntax highlight styles from <a href="http://aerotwist.com/" target="_blank">Paul</a>. Thanks Paul! It's awesome!

Here's a sneak peak:

{% highlight javascript %}
var fluidvids = require('fluidvids.js/dist/fluidvids')();

var rwdVideos = function () {
  fluidvids.init({
    selector: ['iframe', 'object'],
    players: ['www.youtube.com', 'player.vimeo.com']
  });
};

module.exports = {
  rwdVideos: rwdVideos
};
{% endhighlight %}

Neat, uh?

And that's all! The code is on my GitHub => `AgtLucas/the-legacy`.
